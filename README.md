# Restful API

### Preface
This is a Spring Boot based API working in java environment. The API stores the detail of the user with the parameters name, id, language and framework. The complete API responds to all the calls made from Postman and the data is stored in MongoDB Database using mongo-express plugin. The data can also be accessed through the web. A sample react app is also created to see how the frontend can probably look like and an idea can be set for how the restful API might be looking when controlled with the frontend. But the JSON is easily visible on the localhost over the web.

### Maven
Maven was the Java framework which allowed us to set the base for the Spring Boot Application and also for the deployment of the application through Kubernetes. Maven is also bestowed with a set of dependencies that allow us to make several tasks simpler.

### Docker
Docker is the platform that helped us in multiple ways. Although a docker image stands a must for deployments and pipelines, but it can come to even more use. Docker allowed us to build the Kubernetes deployment. It pushed the whole metadata into a docker image via jar file, the docker image was then available to be pushed to the container thereby deploying the application in Kubernetes cluster.

### Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system for automating software deployment, scaling, and management. The containers basically contain clusters of metadata. These clusters are readily available for deployment in any system with respect to the dynamic changes that continue to be deployed on real time basis. Deployment thus stands one of the primary requirements in application development and building.

### CI/CD pipeline
A continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline is a series of steps that must be performed in order to deliver a new version of software. CI/CD pipelines are a practice focused on improving software delivery throughout the software development life cycle via automation. It helps in an extensive support to build whatever, whenever we want.
